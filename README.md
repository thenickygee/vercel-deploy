# Vercel Deploy GitHub Action

A custom GitHub Action workflow to deploy your project to Vercel automatically when pushing to main.

## Problem Solved

Have you ever encountered this error?

```diff
- Error: Git author [userEmail] must have access to the team [teamName] on Vercel to create deployments.
```

This workflow solves that issue by properly configuring automated Vercel deployments through GitHub Actions.
